Besides Leonardo Dicaprio winning an oscar for his leading role in The Revenant, there was other news coming from this years oscars.

          <h4 class="heading">Batman V. Superman Hate Campaign</h4>
        With only 18 days until the realease of Batman V. Superman the hype for the movie is starting to build up. This statemanet is not true for all though. After the infamous "Doomsday trailer" Batman V. Superman has been recieving undeserved hate. In my opinion this movie deserves a chance and even with this hate campaign against it this movie will still do well. I mean it is the first time Batman V. Superman will apear on the screen together. I think this also connets to other movies that aren't getting a fair chance because of these hate campaign being run against them. Hopefully these hate campaigns will stop so people can actually enjoy their movies.

          <h4 class="heading">Ghostbusters Trailer Released-Is it Any Good?</h4>
          <iframe width="398" height="249" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w3ugHP-yZXw" frameborder="10" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          
                   No. It isn't any good. This trailer just didn't entice me into watching this movie. A movie that has the huge job of rebooting on of the most infulencial movies of all time, has to come out of the gate with a great trailer and this trailer just didn't do it. I feel that this movie should still get a chance which just isn't happening. Looking at the trailer on Youtube it now has more dislikes than likes which is surprising for a movie like this. Even though this trailer didn't really get me excited for this movie there were some things I liked about this. For one, despite the general public opinion, I am not bothered about about an all female team. I feel the gender of the ghostbuster team memembers doesn't really matter for me as long as the movie is good. Another thing that I liked about this trailer is actress, Leslie Jones. I thought by far she was the funniest person in this trailer and was really the only team memeber I really liked coming out of this trailer. The main thing that I didn't like about this trailer the fact they sold this movie as a sequel which I thought is was. The fact that I thought this movie was a sequel for two days until I finally heard it wasn't, is just a terrible job done by the marketing team. Well thats what I thought about the movie and I hope to talk about this more when I review it after it's July 14, 2016 release date.

          <h4 class="heading">Venom Movie Anounced</h4>
          Wow Deadpool has really effected the movies quickly. After Deadpool, studios are now more open to the ideas of an R rated comic book movie which, even though the rating hasn't been anounced, is what this movie is going to be rated. I, as someone who hasn't and is not going to see Deadpool because of it's R rating, am upset about how fast this R rated comic book movie trend has started. But, for me, a Venom movie is more interesting to me than a Deadpool movie. The Venom movie looses me though with the fact that it isn't going to have Spider Man in it and I just can't see a Venom movie without Spider Man. Well I am still execited to see this movie even becuse of this fact. I will review this movie when released.

          <h4 class="heading">No R in Disney</h4>
          With the sucess of Deadpool R rated comic book movies have been popping up everywhere with the Wolvorine movie rumored to be R and a new Venom movie anounced which is most likely going to be R. This made people ask the question if Marvel will make an R rated comic book movie and Disney, the owner of Marvel, clearly gave an answer. And that answer was no. But that is what Netflix is for. Netflix has been Marvel's platform for dark and more intense properties and this has been working for Marvel. I think that this was the right answer coming from Marvel because their movie formula has been working and they don't need to make an R rated movie.

          <h4 class="heading">21 Jump Street Men and Black Cross Over Anounced</h4>
          I feel this is a terrible idea. I myself have not see 21 or 22 Jump Street movies but I love the Men and Black movies and I just don't see this working out. Also I heard that Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones which extremly dissapoints me. One thing this movie does do is it makes me want to see 21 and 22 Jump Street which is good for the studio owning these two proporties. Also I feel The Men and Black movie franchise is over. It has ended and I don't think it should continue. Still I will see this movie and I will review it when it is realeased.

          Well, I see it. My first reaction was, "no. this is terrible". But after I got over my brain fart of forgetting he played Jay Jonah Jameson which helped me see him in this role. Also I feel he should have been introduced in Batman V. Superman and it is a mystery why he is in a Justice League movie. We will see what happens when this movie is realeased and when I will review it.

          <h4 class="heading">Zootopia Better than Frozen?</h4>
          Well if you look at the box office numbers yes the new Disney animated movie Zootopia has had the biggest opening weekend of 73.7 million dollars which is bigger than Frozen, which is one of the biggest Disney animated movies of all time. This is great for a movie that I wasn't going to see but now I think this could of changed my mind and I will review it soon.

          <img width="150" height="150" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CmRih_VtVAs/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="">
          Just skip Batman V. Superman and get excited for a movie we are so confident in that we have already started making the second one. This is basicly what Warner Brothers is now basically telling people now and I am now listening to them. After this anouncements and trailers for both movies being released I am now more excited for Suicide Squad than Batman V. Superman which is not good for Warner Brothers. They are cannibalizeing their own movies. But I am still going to see both of these movies and I will review both.

          Huh? Well this role is confusing me. I have only seen this actress in my sister's favorite Disney TV shows and for a movie that really has to be good to give confidence back into this huge property of Spider Man which hasn't been the best comic book movie franchise. I'm not sure if this is the best desision for this movie but I will still review this movie and I am excited to see it.
